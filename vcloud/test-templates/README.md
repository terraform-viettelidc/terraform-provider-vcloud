# Test templates

The files listed below are samples for the creation of customised tests using `terraform-provider-vcd`.
They are not to be considered as a full suite or a definitive test for the repository feature. 
They are just the first iteration of a set of samples, to take as model to create more robust and comprehensive tests when adding new features or when testing a combination of existing features.

* misc1.tf
* misc2.tf
* sample.tf

Their contents may change in further releases, or they can be replaed by more interesting examples.

That said, these tests should run correctly, and you should expect them to execute without errors, provided that you have a well defined configuration file `vcd_test_config.json`.

See `TESTING.md` for detailed instructions on how to use these files and to create new ones.
