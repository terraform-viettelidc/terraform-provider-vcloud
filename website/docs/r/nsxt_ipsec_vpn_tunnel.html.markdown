  Provides a resource to manage NSX-T IPsec VPN Tunnel. You can configure site-to-site connectivity between an NSX-T Data
  Center Edge Gateway and remote sites. The remote sites must use NSX-T Data Center, have third-party hardware routers, 
  or VPN gateways that support IPSec.

# vcloud\_nsxt\_ipsec\_vpn\_tunnel

Provides a resource to manage NSX-T IPsec VPN Tunnel. You can configure site-to-site connectivity between an NSX-T Data
Center Edge Gateway and remote sites. The remote sites must use NSX-T Data Center, have third-party hardware routers,
or VPN gateways that support IPSec.

## Example Usage (IPsec VPN Tunnel with default Security Profile)

```hcl
resource "vcloud_nsxt_ipsec_vpn_tunnel" "tunnel1" {
  org = "my-org"

  edge_gateway_id = data.vcloud_nsxt_edgegateway.existing.id

  name        = "First"
  description = "testing tunnel"

  pre_shared_key = "my-presharaed-key"
  # Primary IP address of Edge Gateway pulled from data source
  local_ip_address = tolist(data.vcloud_nsxt_edgegateway.existing_gw.subnet)[0].primary_ip
  local_networks   = ["10.10.10.0/24", "30.30.30.0/28", "40.40.40.1/32"]
  # That is a fake remote IP address
  remote_ip_address = "1.2.3.4"
  remote_networks   = ["192.168.1.0/24", "192.168.10.0/24", "192.168.20.0/28"]
}
```

## Example Usage (IPsec VPN Tunnel with customized Security Profile)

```hcl
resource "vcloud_nsxt_ipsec_vpn_tunnel" "tunnel1" {
  org = "my-org"

  edge_gateway_id = data.vcloud_nsxt_edgegateway.existing.id

  name        = "customized-sec-profile"
  description = "IPsec VPN Tunnel with customized security profile"

  pre_shared_key = "test-psk"
  # Primary IP address of Edge Gateway
  local_ip_address = tolist(data.vcloud_nsxt_edgegateway.existing_gw.subnet)[0].primary_ip
  local_networks   = ["10.10.10.0/24", "30.30.30.0/28", "40.40.40.1/32"]
  # That is a fake remote IP address as there is nothing else to peer to
  remote_ip_address = "1.2.3.4"
  remote_networks   = ["192.168.1.0/24", "192.168.10.0/24", "192.168.20.0/28"]

  security_profile_customization {
    ike_version               = "IKE_V2"
    ike_encryption_algorithms = ["AES_128"]
    ike_digest_algorithms     = ["SHA2_256"]
    ike_dh_groups             = ["GROUP14"]
    ike_sa_lifetime           = 86400

    tunnel_pfs_enabled           = true
    tunnel_df_policy             = "COPY"
    tunnel_encryption_algorithms = ["AES_256"]
    tunnel_digest_algorithms     = ["SHA2_256"]
    tunnel_dh_groups             = ["GROUP14"]
    tunnel_sa_lifetime           = 3600

    dpd_probe_internal = "30"
  }
}
```

## Example Usage (IPsec VPN Tunnel with Certificate auth and custom remote ID)

```hcl
data "vcloud_library_certificate" "cert" {
  org   = "myOrg"
  alias = "certificate"
}

data "vcloud_library_certificate" "ca-cert" {
  org   = "myOrg"
  alias = "ca-certificate"
}

resource "vcloud_nsxt_ipsec_vpn_tunnel" "tunnel1" {
  org = "my-org"

  edge_gateway_id = data.vcloud_nsxt_edgegateway.existing.id

  name = "cert-tunnel"

  authentication_mode = "CERTIFICATE"
  certificate_id      = data.vcloud_library_certificate.cert.id
  ca_certificate_id   = data.vcloud_library_certificate.ca-cert.id

  # Primary IP address of Edge Gateway pulled from data source
  local_ip_address = tolist(data.vcloud_nsxt_edgegateway.existing_gw.subnet)[0].primary_ip
  local_networks   = ["10.10.10.0/24", "30.30.30.0/28", "40.40.40.1/32"]
  # That is a fake remote IP address
  remote_ip_address = "1.2.3.4"

  # The remote ID must match the certificate SAN (Subject Alternative Name), 
  # if available, or the distinguished name of the certificate used to secure 
  # the remote endpoint.
  remote_id       = "cert-san"
  remote_networks = ["192.168.1.0/24", "192.168.10.0/24", "192.168.20.0/28"]
}
```

## Importing

~> The current implementation of Terraform import can only import resources into the state.
It does not generate configuration. [More information.](https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/)

An existing IPSec VPN Tunnel configuration can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource
via supplying the full dot separated path for your IPsec VPN Tunnel name or ID. An example is
below:

[docs-import]: https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/

Supplying Name
```
terraform import vcloud_nsxt_ipsec_vpn_tunnel.imported my-org..my-org-vdc-org-vdc-group-name.my-nsxt-edge-gateway.my-ipsec-vpn-tunnel-name
```



-> When there are multiple IPsec VPN Tunnels with the same name they will all be listed so that one can pick
it by ID

```
$ terraform import vcloud_nsxt_ipsec_vpn_tunnel.first my-org.nsxt-vdc.nsxt-gw.tunnel1
vcloud_nsxt_nat_rule.dnat: Importing from ID "my-org.nsxt-vdc.nsxt-gw.dnat1"...
# The following IPsec VPN Tunnels with Name 'tunnel1' are available
# Please use ID instead of Name in import path to pick exact rule
ID                                   Name    Local IP     Remote IP
04fde766-2cbd-4986-93bb-7f57e59c6b19 tunnel1 1.1.1.1      2.2.2.2
f40e3d68-cfa6-42ea-83ed-5571659b3e7b tunnel1 4.4.4.4      8.8.8.8
$ terraform import vcloud_nsxt_ipsec_vpn_tunnel.imported my-org.my-org-vdc-org-vdc-group-name.my-nsxt-edge-gateway.04fde766-2cbd-4986-93bb-7f57e59c6b19
```

The above would import the `my-ipsec-vpn-tunnel-name` IPsec VPN Tunne config settings that are defined
on NSX-T Edge Gateway `my-nsxt-edge-gateway` which is configured in organization named `my-org` and
VDC or VDC Group named `my-org-vdc-org-vdc-group-name`.
