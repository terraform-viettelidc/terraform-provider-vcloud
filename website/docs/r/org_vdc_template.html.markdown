  [`vcloud_org` data source](/providers/terraform-viettelidc/vcloud/latest/docs/data-sources/org)

## Importing

~> **Note:** The current implementation of Terraform import can only import resources into the state. It does not generate
configuration. [More information.][docs-import]

An existing Organization VDC Template can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via supplying its System name (`name`).
For example, using this structure, representing an existing Organization VDC Template that was **not** created using Terraform:

```hcl
resource "vcloud_org_vdc_template" "an_existing_vdc_template" {
  # ...
}
```

You can import such Organization VDC Template into Terraform state using one of the following commands

```
terraform import vcloud_org_vdc_template.an_existing_vdc_template "MyTemplate"
```

After that, you must expand the configuration file before you can either update or delete the Organization VDC Template. Running `terraform plan`
at this stage will show the difference between the minimal configuration file and the stored properties.
