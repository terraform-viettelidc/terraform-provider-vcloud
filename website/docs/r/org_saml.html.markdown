# vcd\_org\_saml

Provides a Viettel IDC Cloud Organization SAML resource. This can be used to create, update, and delete SAML configuration for an organization.

Supported in provider *v3.10+*

-> **Note:** This resource requires system administrator privileges.

## Example Usage with metadata file

```hcl
data "vcloud_org" "my-org" {
  name = "my-org"
}

resource "vcloud_org_saml" "my-org-saml" {
  org_id                          = data.vcloud_org.my-org.id
  enabled                         = true
  entity_id                       = "my-entity"
  identity_provider_metadata_file = "idp-metadata.xml"
  email                           = "email"
  username                        = "uname"
  firstname                       = "fname"
  fullname                        = "fullname"
  surname                         = "lname"

  group                           = "group"
}
```

## Example Usage with metadata text

```hcl
data "vcloud_org" "my-org" {
  name = "my-org"
}

data "http" "example" {
  url = "https://samltest.id/saml/idp"
}

resource "vcloud_org_saml" "my-org-saml" {
  org_id                          = data.vcloud_org.my-org.id
  enabled                         = true
  entity_id                       = "my-entity"
  identity_provider_metadata_text = data.http.example.response_body
  email                           = "email"
  username                        = "uname"
  firstname                       = "fname"
  fullname                        = "fullname"
  surname                         = "lname"
  role                            = "role"
  group                           = "group"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `org_id` - (Required) Since there is only one SAML configuration available for an organization, the resource can be identified by the Org itself
* `enabled` - (Required) If true, the organization will use SAML for authentication
* `entity_id` - (Optional) Your service provider entity ID. Once you set this field, it cannot be changed back to empty
* `identity_provider_metadata_file` - (Optional) Name of a file containing the metadata text from a SAML Identity Provider. Required if `identity_provider_metadata_text` is not defined
* `identity_provider_metadata_text` - (Optional) Text of the metadata text from a SAML Identity Provider. Required if `identity_provider_metadata_file` is not defined
* `group` - (Optional) The name of the SAML attribute that returns the identifiers of all the groups of which the user is a member
* `role` - (Optional) The name of the SAML attribute that returns the identifiers of all roles of the user
* `email` - (Optional) The name of the SAML attribute that returns the email address of the user
* `first_name` - (Optional) The name of the SAML attribute that returns the first name of the user
* `surname` - (Optional) The name of the SAML attribute that returns the surname of the user
* `full_name` - (Optional) The name of the SAML attribute that returns the full name of the user
* `user_name` - (Optional) The name of the SAML attribute that returns the username of the user

## Importing

~> **Note:** The current implementation of Terraform import can only import resources into the state. It does not generate
configuration. [More information.][docs-import]

An existing SAML configuration for an Org can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via supplying the path for an Org. Since the Org is
at the top of the VCD hierarchy, the path corresponds to the Org name.
For example, using this structure, representing an existing SAML configuration that was **not** created using Terraform:

```hcl
data "vcloud_org" "my-org" {
  name = "my-org"
}

resource "vcloud_org_saml" "my-org-saml" {
  org_id                          = data.vcloud_org.my-org.id
  enabled                         = true
  identity_provider_metadata_file = "somefile.xml"
}
```

You can import such SAML configuration into terraform state using one of the following commands

```
terraform import vcloud_org_saml.my-org-saml organization_name
# OR
terraform import vcloud_org_saml.my-org-saml organization_id
```

After that, you must expand the configuration file before you can either update or delete the SAML configuration. Running `terraform plan`
at this stage will show the difference between the minimal configuration file and the stored properties.
