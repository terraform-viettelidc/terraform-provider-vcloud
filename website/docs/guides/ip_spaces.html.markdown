# IP Spaces

Starting with **Viettel IDC Cloud 10.4.1** and **Terraform Provider for VCD 3.10**, you can use
IP Spaces to manage your IP address allocation needs. IP Spaces provide structured approach to
allocating *public* and *private* IP addresses by preventing the use of overlapping IP addresses
across organizations and organization VDCs.

An IP space consists of a set of defined non-overlapping IP ranges and small CIDR blocks that are
reserved and used during the consumption aspect of the IP space life cycle. An IP space can be
either *IPv4* or *IPv6*, but *not both*.

Every IP space has an *internal scope* and an *external scope*. The *internal scope* of an IP space
is a *list of CIDR notations* that defines the exact span of IP addresses in which all ranges and
blocks must be contained in. The *external scope* defines the *total span of IP addresses to which
the IP space has access*, for example the internet or a WAN. The internal and external scopes are
used to define default NAT rules and BGP prefixes.

As a service provider, you create public, shared, or private IP spaces and assign them to provider
gateways by creating IP space uplinks. After creating an IP space, you can assign to it IP prefixes
for networks and floating IP addresses for network services.

Organization administrators can view general information about the IP spaces in their organization,
and manage the IP spaces available to them provided they have access rights.

There are three types of IP spaces that you can create.

* **Public** IP Space - A public IP Space is *used by multiple organizations* and is *controlled by
  the service provider* through a quota-based system. 
* **Shared** IP Space - An IP Space for services and management networks that are required in the
  tenant space, but as a service provider, you don't want to expose it to organizations in your
  environment. Simply put, *only provider* can *perform IP allocations* from such IP Space.
* **Private** IP Space - Private IP Spaces are dedicated to a single tenant - a private IP space is
  used by only one organization that is specified during the space creation. For this organization,
  IP consumption is unlimited.


## List of resources with IP Space support

The following resources for IP Space management are available with Terraform Provider for
VCD starting with version 3.10:

* [`vcloud_ip_space`](/providers/vmware/vcd/latest/docs/resources/ip_space) - provides IP Space and
  default quota definition capability
* [`vcloud_ip_space_uplink`](/providers/vmware/vcd/latest/docs/resources/ip_space_uplink) - provides
  capability to assign IP Space Uplink for Provider Gateways (resource
  [`vcloud_external_network_v2`](/providers/vmware/vcd/latest/docs/resources/external_network_v2))
* [`vcloud_ip_space_ip_allocation`](/providers/vmware/vcd/latest/docs/resources/ip_space_ip_allocation)
  provides capability to allocate floating IPs or IP Prefixes
* [`vcloud_ip_space_custom_quota`](/providers/vmware/vcd/latest/docs/resources/ip_space_custom_quota) -
  provides capability to set Org specific Custom Quotas and override default ones defined in
  [`vcloud_ip_space`](/providers/vmware/vcd/latest/docs/resources/ip_space_custom_quota)
* [`vcloud_external_network_v2`](/providers/vmware/vcd/latest/docs/resources/external_network_v2) -
  fields `use_ip_spaces` and `dedicated_org_id` (applicable only to T0 or T0 VRF backed networks
  also known as Provider Gateways in UI)
* [`vcloud_nsxt_edgegateway`](/providers/vmware/vcd/latest/docs/resources/nsxt_edgegateway) - none of
  the fields `subnet_with_total_ip_count`, `subnet`, `subnet_with_ip_count` are mandatory when
  specifying `external_network_id` that is using IP Spaces. As a result they will not be populated
  after read operations together with `used_ip_count` and `unused_ip_count`. Additional computed
  flag `use_ip_spaces` to tell if the Edge Gateway is using IP Spaces (is backed by Provider Gateway
  that has IP Space Uplinks)


-> There are new rights for IP Space management starting with VCD 10.4.1. Some of them are [listed
in the
prerequisites](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.4/VMware-Cloud-Director-Service-Provider-Admin-Portal-Guide/GUID-575513A8-9ADE-4A3D-92AB-CB0917FF8316.html)
for IP Space management in Organizations.

## Sample configuration without IP Spaces (the original way)

Without IP Spaces, IP address mapping happens in every separate resource - one has to make correct
IP mappings in every resource. Management of allocations and correctnes is user's responsibility.

```hcl
resource "vcloud_external_network_v2" "provider-gateway" {
  name = "without-ip-spaces"

  nsxt_network {
    nsxt_manager_id      = data.vcloud_nsxt_manager.main.id
    nsxt_tier0_router_id = data.vcloud_nsxt_tier0_router.router.id
  }

  ip_scope {
    # enabled       = true # by default
    gateway       = "11.11.11.1"
    prefix_length = "24"

    static_ip_pool {
      start_address = "11.11.11.100"
      end_address   = "11.11.11.110"
    }
  }
}

resource "vcloud_nsxt_edgegateway" "ip-space" {
  org                 = "cloudOrg"
  name                = "nsxt-edge-gateway"
  owner_id            = data.vcloud_org_vdc.vdc1.id
  external_network_id = vcloud_external_network_v2.provider-gateway.id

  subnet {
    gateway       = "11.11.11.1"
    prefix_length = "24"
    primary_ip    = "11.11.11.100"

    # IP Allocation occurs in Edge Gateway
    allocated_ips {
      start_address = "11.11.11.100"
      end_address   = "11.11.11.108"
    }
  }
}

resource "vcloud_nsxt_nat_rule" "dnat-rule" {
  org             = "cloudOrg"
  edge_gateway_id = vcloud_nsxt_edgegateway.ip-space.id

  name      = "dnat-with-ip-from-range"
  rule_type = "DNAT"

  # Using Floating IP From IP Space
  external_address = tolist(vcloud_nsxt_edgegateway.ip-space.subnet)[0].end_address
  internal_address = "77.77.77.1"
  logging          = true
}
```

## Sample end to end configuration using IP Spaces

All resources have their own documentation, but this snippet gives a birds eye view how all the
components integrate into a single picture when using IP Spaces. 

The main difference from the above example before IP Space support - one does not need to map IPs in
each resource. Available IP Ranges and Prefixes are defined in an IP Space. IPs and Prefixes can
then be allocated dynamically (using
[`vcloud_ip_space_ip_allocation`](/providers/vmware/vcd/latest/docs/resources/ip_space_ip_allocation)
resource).

Here is what this snippet does: 

* Creates a [Public IP Space](/providers/vmware/vcd/latest/docs/resources/ip_space) with IP Prefixes
  (Subnets) and IP Ranges (Floating IP ranges)
* Creates a [Provider Gateway] (/providers/vmware/vcd/latest/docs/resources/external_network_v2)
  that has an [IP Space Uplink](/providers/vmware/vcd/latest/docs/resources/ip_space_uplink) with
  the newly created IP Space. 
* Creates an [NSX-T Edge Gateway](/providers/vmware/vcd/latest/docs/resources/nsxt_edgegateway)
  backed by newly created Provider Gateway. **Note** IP Space IP allocations can be performed in the
  VDC *only* after this step as it maps the IP Space to a particular VDC.
* Creates a DNAT rule
  [`vcloud_nsxt_nat_rule`](/providers/vmware/vcd/latest/docs/resources/nsxt_nat_rule) that uses
  Floating IP allocated by
  [`vcloud_ip_space_ip_allocation`](/providers/vmware/vcd/latest/docs/resources/ip_space_ip_allocation)
  resource.
* Allocates a floating IP for manual usage using 
  [`vcloud_ip_space_ip_allocation`](/providers/vmware/vcd/latest/docs/resources/ip_space_ip_allocation)
  resource (usage_state="USED_MANUAL")
* Creates a [routed network](/providers/vmware/vcd/latest/docs/resources/routed_network_v2) and
  uses [IP Prefix allocation](/providers/vmware/vcd/latest/docs/resources/ip_space_ip_allocation)

```hcl
